## Original README file ##
DRINKS Toolkit is a collection of web-based widget powered with HTML5 Canvas API and Javascript, designed to make easily and fast development on webpages. 
In this first release we have developed a toolkit based to realize web instruments, but in the future DRINKS, will be more than a toolkit. We want to create many others instruments, realize hardware to control everything, provide support, and useful features to make your work faster and easier and create web widgets that can improve your web development.
Using just one tag you can manipulate a more complex javascript interface taking advantage of the power of HTML, so you can create your instrument using Drinks API, bind it to a tag and include it to your web pages easily.
